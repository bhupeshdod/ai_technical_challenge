## Traveling with children and infants

We are committed to caring for people on life’s journey and want you and your children to have a safe and positive travel experience. To allow enough time for check-in, arrive early and be sure to have any required travel documents. You may have to present proof of age like a birth certificate for any children under the age of 18.

- Families with children under 2 years old can ask to board early at the gate.
- Only 1 carry-on diaper bag per child is allowed.

[Nursing mothers Expand](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/special-assistance/traveling-children.jsp#nursingmothers)

You can travel with a breast pump and small, soft-sided cooler of breast milk in addition to your carry-on or personal item. These items don’t have to be checked and are allowed even when you’re not traveling with a child. Also, most airports have nursing rooms and stations available for your convenience.

If you’re a family traveling with children under 15, we want to help make sure you’re seated together on your flight. Here are some tips for when you book:

- Be sure to book everyone in the same reservation.
- The farther in advance you book, the better. (Seats become limited closer to the day of travel.)
- On the seat map, choose seats for your entire family or skip seats for that flight.
- It’s better to skip seats than to choose just a few seats or seats scattered throughout the cabin. Our gate agents can try to reseat you but getting seats together the day of travel is difficult.

### If you skip seats

If you’re unable to choose seats, don’t want to pay for seats, or chose a Basic Economy fare, our system will detect that you’re a family traveling. The system will search for seats together automatically before the day of departure. We’ll try our best to keep you together, but if seats are limited, we’ll assign seats so children under 15 are next to at least 1 adult.

### Children and adults traveling in separate reservations

If you and your children are traveling together but have separate reservations, call Reservations so we can note it in each reservation.

[Contact Reservations](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/contact-american/reservations-and-ticket-changes.jsp)

[Children (2 years or older) Expand](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/special-assistance/traveling-children.jsp#childrentwoandolder)

Children 2 or older are required to have their own seat, a ticketed adult fare. Children under 5 can’t travel alone under any circumstances.

If you don't choose seats in Main Cabin or Basic Economy, we’ll assign seats a few days after you buy your tickets so children under 15 are next to at least 1 adult they’re traveling with.

[Infants (under 2 years) Expand](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/special-assistance/traveling-children.jsp#infants)

We welcome infants as young as 2 days old, but infants under 7 days old must have a doctor's letter stating that they are medically cleared to travel.

Keep in mind:

- Only 1 infant may be seated in the lap of each ticketed accompanying adult and the infant must be included in the reservation.
- Additional infants under 2 years old must be ticketed and occupy an infant safety seat or in a separate aircraft seat.
- The infant must be under 2 years of age for the duration of the trip. If they turn 2 during a trip, they will need their own seat for the remainder of the trip.

### Adding an infant to your trip

If you’re traveling within the U.S., including Puerto Rico, you can add an infant to your trip when you book on aa.com, or later once it is ticketed. You only need to contact Reservations if you’re traveling with an infant who is under 7 days old; or if you’re traveling outside of the U.S. (taxes and a percentage of the adult fare may apply on international trips).

#### Book a new trip

[Contact Reservations](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/contact-american/reservations-and-ticket-changes.jsp)

### Reserved seat

If your infant will travel in their own seat, you must buy a ticket. The infant must either travel in a safety seat approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or be able to sit upright in their seat without assistance and have their seatbelt securely fastened during taxi, takeoff, landing and whenever the 'fasten seatbelt' sign is on.

### Bassinets and changing tables

- Changing tables are available in the lavatories of all wide-body aircraft.
- Bassinets are available on a first come, first serve basis at the gate for travel only on 777-200, 777-300 and 787 aircraft.\*
- Bassinets are not available in First / Business cabins.

\*Infants using bassinets must be younger than 2 years old and weigh no more than 20lbs (9kg)

## Acceptable safety seats

Most safety seats that are approved for use in motor vehicles are acceptable for use in aircraft. The seat must have a solid back and seat, restraint straps installed to securely hold the child and a label indicating approval for use on an aircraft.

The label may include:

- These notes: 'This child restraint system conforms to all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards' and 'this restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircrafts' or 'this restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft.'
- Approval of a foreign government or a label showing that the seat was manufactured under the standards of the United Nations.

[Safety seat requirements Expand](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/special-assistance/traveling-children.jsp#safetyseatrequirements)

- The safety seat can't be used in an exit row or in the rows on either side of an exit row; window seats are preferred.
- Install the seat in the direction appropriate for the size of the child and according to the instructions on the label.
- The child must remain in the safety seat with the harness fastened during taxi, takeoff, landing and whenever the 'fasten seatbelt' sign is on.
- To carry on a safety seat, you must have bought a seat for the child, or a seat must be available next to you. If an unoccupied, adjoining seat is not available, the gate agent will check the safety seat to your final destination.

Review seat dimensions before your trip.

## International documents

Children or infants traveling outside the U.S. are required to have the same documentation as an adult. If anyone under 18 is traveling internationally without both parents, they may be required to present a Letter of Consent.
