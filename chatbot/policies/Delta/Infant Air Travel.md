# Infant Air Travel

---

We’re here to take you and your family wherever you need to go.  Infants or children under 2 years of age can travel on the lap of an adult for free (within the United States) or at a reduced fare (for international travel). You also may purchase a ticket and use the child’s own seat on the aircraft as long as it meets the FAA-approved child safety seat specifications or use a CARES harness. Our [step-by-step guide](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/children-infant-travel/overview#review) explains how to easily add a lap-held infant (Infant-in-Arms) to your ticket yourself.

Due to FAA safety requirements, 1 adult passenger may only carry 1 lap-held infant. If an adult passenger is traveling with 2 infants, a seat must be purchased for the additional infant. Infants occupying a seat on domestic flights require a ticket and pay the applicable fare.

## Pregnant Passengers

---

At Delta, we don’t impose restrictions on flying if you’re pregnant and don’t require a medical certificate for your travel. If you're traveling after your eighth month, it's a good idea to check with your doctor to be sure travel is not restricted. Keep in mind, ticket change fees and penalties cannot be waived for pregnancy.

## Bassinets or SkyCots

---

For some of our smallest passengers on some international flights, we offer onboard baby bassinets. They’re ideal for babies weighing up to 20 lbs. (9 kg) and up to 26 inches (66 cm) long.

- Onboard bassinets, also known as SkyCots, are available free of charge for passengers in select seats on equipped aircraft for some international flights
- SkyCots can be requested by contacting [Reservations](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/need-help/overview) before arriving at the airport and then speaking with the gate agent at the boarding gate, but cannot be guaranteed due to a limit of two SkyCots per aircraft and weight restrictions
- Please note that all infants must be held during takeoff, landing and whenever the seat belt light is on

## Additional Infant Travel Information

---

For children under the age of two, we recommend you purchase a seat on the aircraft and use an approved child safety seat. Here are some other helpful tips for traveling with your infant or toddler:

### Breastfeeding

Delta fully supports a woman’s right to breastfeed on board Delta and Delta Connection aircraft and in Delta facilities. Breast pumps are allowed on board. At the airport and if you prefer, many airports do offer private lactation rooms or spaces. Ask a Delta associate if you need assistance locating one at an airport.

### Booking Your Trip

When traveling with an infant or toddler, you may find it helpful to allow a little extra time between flights to take rest or bathroom breaks along the way. Our [Airport maps](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/airports/overview) can help you plan your layovers before you even reach the airport.

### International Flights

If your travel destination requires a passport and/or travel visas, you will need a passport for your child, and possibly extra documentation. To review required documentation in each country you’re visiting or stopping over in, visit the [U.S. Department of State’s Special Requirements for Children](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html/get/minors/minors_834.html834.html).

### Infant Baggage

Review our [Infant & Children's Items guidelines](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/baggage/special-items/children-infant-items) for specific details on carry-on items, including child restraint seats, strollers and diaper bags. During security check in, the TSA will usually make a special provision for items like medications, breast milk and baby formula. Check out the [Traveling with Kids section of the TSA website](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/special-procedures/traveling-children) for information and helpful videos about travel with infants and carry-on baggage restrictions.
