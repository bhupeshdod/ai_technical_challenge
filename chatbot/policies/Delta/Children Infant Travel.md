## Children Traveling Alone

Delta’s committed to providing safe travel for all — especially children traveling by themselves with our [Unaccompanied Minor Program](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/children-infant-travel/unaccompanied-minor-program). For a $150 fee each way, up to 4 children between the ages of 5 to 14 will receive an employee escort and special amenities for a reliable and comfortable trip. Minors between the ages of 15 to 17 can use this program, per parent or guardian request.

- Children traveling as unaccompanied minors receive barcoded wristbands that track their journey
- Parents or guardians can escort unaccompanied minors to the gate area through security
- Children have access to Delta Sky Zone at some airports, a kids-only lounge with video games, snacks and a secure area to hang out between flights
