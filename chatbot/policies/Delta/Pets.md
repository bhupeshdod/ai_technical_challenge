Embark on a journey with your favorite furry companion. Depending on their size, some pets can travel as your carry-on.

Note:  Failure to comply with all pet policies and keep your pet in the kennel at all times while in the airport and onboard the aircraft may result in losing the ability to travel with your pet on future flights.

## Carry-On Pets

---

Small dogs, cats and household birds can travel in the cabin for a one-way fee that is collected at check-in. The pet must be able to fit in a soft-sided ventilated pet kennel that will go underneath the seat directly in front of you.

Please review the following requirements to ensure a safe and healthy flight with a small pet traveling as a carry-on:

- Your pet must be at least 8 weeks old for domestic travel.
- Your pet must be 16 weeks old if traveling to the U.S. from another country and at least 15 weeks old when traveling to the European Union.
- 1 pet is permitted per kennel with the following exceptions:
  - 1 female cat or dog may travel with her un-weaned litter if the litter is between 8 weeks and 6 months of age. There is no limit on the number of animals in the litter as long as they can fit safely in the kennel.
  - 2 pets of the same breed and size between the ages of 8 weeks and 6 months may be allowed to travel in 1 kennel, as long as they are small enough to fit into a single kennel and are compatible. If the pets are allowed to travel in 1 kennel, they will be charged as 1 pet.

Pets in kennels will count as your 1 carry-on item. In addition to the kennel, you are permitted to bring 1 personal item on board the aircraft.

## Seating With Your Pet

---

Customers with carry-on pets may not select seats in the following areas:

- Bulkhead seats
- An emergency exit row
- Seats designated as “no stowage”

## Booking Your Pet

---

To ensure the comfort of all customers, we have a first-come, first-serve policy for pets in the cabin, with a limit on the total number allowed on each flight. If your pet meets the above requirements and you have a reservation, please contact [Delta Reservations](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/need-help/overview#messageUs "Delta Reservations") as soon as possible to book your pet. We also ask that you have your pet’s kennel dimensions (length, width and height) available when you call.

## Carry-On Kennel Requirements

---

Be sure to check the [aircraft dimensions](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/aircraft/overview "Delta aircraft overview") of your flight to ensure your pet’s kennel will fit underneath the seat directly in front of you.

Your pet and kennel must also adhere to the following requirements:

- Your pet must be small enough to fit comfortably in a kennel with the ability to move around without touching or sticking out from the sides.
- The kennel must fit underneath the seat directly in front of you.
- The soft-sided kennel must be leak-proof and have ventilation openings on 3 sides for domestic travel and 4 sides for international travel.
- The maximum carry-on kennel dimensions are determined by the aircraft dimensions of your flight, as the under-seat space varies by aircraft. Delta recommends a soft-sided kennel with maximum dimensions of 18” x 11” x 11” since this fits most aircraft types.
- Your pet must remain inside the kennel with the door secured while in a Delta boarding area, during boarding and deplaning, while in a Delta Sky Club® and while on board the aircraft.

## Checking In With Your Pet

---

When you arrive at the airport, you will need to visit the Special Service Counter to check-in with your pet. At check-in, a Delta agent will ensure your pet and kennel meet the necessary requirements for your trip and collect the required pet fee. Remember to allow extra time at check-in for us to ensure your pet is ready for take-off.

Once you are checked in and have your cabin pet tag, you are ready to go through the security checkpoint where you are required to remove your pet from their kennel.

After the security checkpoint, your pet must remain in their kennel while at the airport, unless they are in a designated relief area.

## Delta Sky Club® Pets

---

Keep in mind that if you visit a Delta Sky Club with your pet, our policies are the same as the aircraft. For the comfort and safety of everyone, your pet must stay in its kennel. One of our representatives can assist you with locating a [pet relief area](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/accessible-travel-services/service-animals#expander-image-panel-r_expander_579171538_1 "pet relief area"), which is available to customers with pets and trained service animals at most airports.

## Carry-On Pet Fees

---

_CAD amount will be charged to exit Canada, while EUR amount will be charged to exit Europe. These fees are established by the [contract of carriage](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/legal/contract-of-carriage-dgr "Delta contract of carriage") in effect at the time of ticket issuance._

The CDC has an [ongoing, temporary suspension](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/high-risk-dog-ban-frn.html "CDC dog ban from high-risk countries") that prohibits the entry of dogs, including trained service animals, into the United States from countries that are at high-risk for rabies. During the suspension, options for bringing dogs that have been in a [high-risk country for rabies](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/high-risk.html "high-risk country for rabies") within the past 6 months will depend on where the dogs’ rabies vaccinations were administered, and the number of dogs being imported. Dogs from high-risk countries must appear healthy, be microchipped and at least 6 months of age. For dogs with a travel history in high-risk countries, please review the [CDC’s guidance on importation](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/high-risk-dog-ban-frn.html "CDC dog ban from high-risk countries").
