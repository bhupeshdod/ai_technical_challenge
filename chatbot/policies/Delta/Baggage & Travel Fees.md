## Flight Partner Baggage

---

We wouldn't be everywhere we are today without some connections of our own. We've partnered with a wide range of travel services to offer you a complete and seamless suite of options. Please visit our [flight partner information page](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/baggage/additional-baggage-information/flight-partners) to learn more.

$('.content-block a\[id\]').each(function() { var $anchorElement = $(this); $anchorElement.attr('class', 'anchor-class'); });

## Travel Changes

---

### **Same-day Travel Changes**

Most fares for domestic travel on Delta are eligible for same-day flight changes. Some tickets don’t offer change eligibility, such as international travel and Basic Economy (E) fares.

### **Same-day Confirmed**

If there is space available in the fare class you originally purchased, you may be able to select the Same-Day Change check-in option and pay a $75 Same-Day Change Fee to confirm a seat on a new flight. This fee does not apply to Delta Gold, Platinum and Diamond Medallion Members.

### **Same-day Standby**

At the time of your change request, you may be able to select this option for a standby seat on a new flight for free. You won’t lose your seat on your original flight unless your standby seat clears.

$('.content-block a\[id\]').each(function() { var $anchorElement = $(this); $anchorElement.attr('class', 'anchor-class'); });

### **Standard Flight Changes**

For all tickets purchased on/after March 31, 2021 in order for you to [keep the value](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/change-cancel/cancel-flight#noshowpolicy) of your ticket, be sure to cancel or make changes prior to departure. Based on the fare rules, you may have to pay a change fee and/or a difference in fare. Basic Economy tickets cannot be changed. However, you may cancel Basic Economy tickets and a cancellation charge will be deducted from the value of your ticket; remaining value will be issued as an [eCredit](https://www.delta.com/edocs/redeem-documents).

### **How the Change Fee Works**

1.  If you want to make a change, check your original ticket for specific fare rules regarding change fees
2.  Pay the price difference between your original ticket
3.  Pay the change fee according to your flight’s origin, if applicable
4.  Receive confirmation for your new flight

$('.content-block a\[id\]').each(function() { var $anchorElement = $(this); $anchorElement.attr('class', 'anchor-class'); });

### **Award Ticket Changes**

We continue to simplify travel by eliminating change fees and redeposit fees for Award Tickets and mileage upgrades for travel within the U.S. (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), as well as international travel originating in the U.S. and Canada. Changes can be made any time prior to departure.

Basic Economy Award Tickets cannot be changed in most cases. However, you may cancel your Basic Economy Award Travel for a cancellation fee of 9,900 miles for domestic travel (within the United States and Canada) and 19,900 miles for international travel. The fee will be deducted from the value of your ticket, and any remaining mileage will be redeposited into your SkyMiles account.

### **Redeposit of Miles for Award Tickets/Mileage Upgrades**

In addition to eliminating change fees for tickets originating in the United States and Canada to anywhere in the world,\* we have also eliminated the redeposit fee for Award Tickets and mileage upgrades originating in the United States or Canada. There are no change fees for travel within the U.S. (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), international travel originating in the U.S. and Canada and travel between the [Caribbean](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/baggage/additional-baggage-information/regions) and the U.S.\* You may redeposit miles any time prior to departure. A redeposit fee of $150 will still apply for Award Tickets and mileage upgrades for travel originating outside of the United States and Canada.

\*Excluding Basic Economy tickets which are non-refundable and non-changeable in most cases. However, you may cancel your Basic Economy Award Travel for a cancellation fee of 9,900 miles for domestic travel (within the United States and Canada) and 19,900 miles for international travel. The fee will be deducted from the value of your ticket and any remaining mileage will be redeposited into your SkyMiles account.

$('.content-block a\[id\]').each(function() { var $anchorElement = $(this); $anchorElement.attr('class', 'anchor-class'); });

## Change and Cancel Fees

---

Review the change and cancel fees below that range from $0 to $400\* based on your origin, destination and type of ticket. For Main Cabin and above travel originating from the 50 United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the change fee is $0, but a fare difference will apply for ticket changes. If your new flight costs less than your current flight, you may be issued an eCredit for the difference (minus any applicable change fees). Remember that a fare difference will still apply for any ticket changes.

The [Change and Cancel Waiver](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/advisories/other-alerts/change-cancel-waiver-from-asia-and-oceania) is still in effect for flights originating from Asia, Oceania and Israel so customers may continue to change or cancel their flight from these regions without incurring a fee.

\*Unless expressly stated otherwise, all fee amounts are stated in US Dollars.

### **Unaccompanied Minors**

The [unaccompanied minor program](https://www.delta.com/us/en/children-infant-travel/unaccompanied-minor-program) provides an employee escort and amenities for children traveling alone between the ages of 5 to 14; or 15 to 17 with guardian request.

[Checked Baggage Update](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/baggage/overview#expander-image-panel-copy_of_expander_620_2)

Delta does not sell baggage in advance through third parties, including travel agencies. Any third party charging a fee for any kind of checked baggage (or special items like sporting equipment) for travel on Delta is not authorized to do so.
