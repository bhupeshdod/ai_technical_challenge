Travel Flexibility

### Change & Cancel

---

**How does Delta’s change policy impact my current ticket and the changing of my origin or destination?**

Enjoy more peace of mind with no change fees when you purchase a Main Cabin or above ticket on flights originating from the United States, Canada, or the **[Caribbean](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/baggage/additional-baggage-information/regions#loaded)**. For tickets where travel begins outside of these regions, **[change and cancel fees](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/baggage/overview)** may apply depending on your origin location and type of ticket.

When changing your ticket, sometimes your new flight may cost more than your original flight. If this happens, you will need to pay the difference in price. In cases where the price of your new flight is less than the original price or if you choose to cancel your flight before departure, you will receive an **[eCredit](https://www.delta.com/edocs/redeem-documents)** for the difference between the price of your original ticket and the price of your new ticket.

As a reminder, Basic Economy tickets cannot be changed in most cases. You may cancel before departure for a cancellation charge which is deducted from the value of your ticket and the remaining value will be issued as an eCredit to use toward a future Delta ticket.

Visit **[My Trips](https://www.delta.com/mytrips/index.action)** or the **[Fly Delta app](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/delta-digital/mobile)** to make your changes.

### eCredits & Refunds

---

**Can I request a refund if there is a significant delay, cancellation or schedule change by Delta?**

In keeping with our longstanding policy, we will first attempt to rebook you on a new flight if your current flight is canceled, significantly delayed (> 120 minutes) or impacted by a qualifying significant schedule change.

If we cannot find an alternate flight for you and we cancel your ticket, or you choose to cancel the new flight you have been rebooked on, you have the following options:

- Receive an eCredit for the value of the ticket, seat upgrade or Preferred Seat
- Adjust your itinerary in **[My Trips](https://www.delta.com/mytrips/index.action)**; or
- **[Request a refund](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/change-cancel/cancel-flight?refund-reimbursement=true)** to your original form of payment once your ticket is canceled

**What if I paid for my original trip with miles or used a Companion Certificate from eligible Delta SkyMiles American Express Cards?**

The same rules apply whether a flight is booked with cash, miles or using a Companion Certificate. For award flights that qualify for a change fee waiver, we are also waiving the mile redeposit fee.

**Where do I go to review and redeem my eCredit value?**

Visit **[delta.com/redeem](https://www.delta.com/edocs/redeem-documents)** where you’ll be able to verify your eCredit value, expiration date and redeem online for future travel.

Review our **[how-to page](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/travel-planning-center/change-or-cancel-your-trip/how-to-rebook)** for tips on managing eCredits.

### Plane Cleanliness & Trip Protection

---

**How is Delta cleaning its aircraft?**

Cleaning crews perform extensive manual cleaning procedures to wipe down cabin surfaces including seats, consoles, seatback screens, windows, doors, lavatories and other high-touch areas of the cabin.

**Why should I add Allianz® Trip Protection to my flight at checkout?**

Get cash back for covered trip cancellations and interruptions, emergency medical costs, lost or damaged luggage, and more. Certain, limited-time **[claim accommodations](https://azcontent.us/alert/2019-novel-coronavirus)** are also being made, such as if you get sick with COVID-19 and can’t fly. Already booked your flight? You may still be able to protect your trip on your **[MyTrips](https://www.delta.com/mytrips/)** page. Terms apply; coverage may vary in some countries or regions.

### Destinations & Travel Restrictions

---

**What should I do if I need a passport or need to renew my passport?**

If you are a U.S. citizen who has reviewed all **[required travel documents](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/check-in-security/required-travel-documents/travel-from-the-us)** and determined you need to receive or renew your passport ahead of international travel, please visit the **[U.S. Department of State’s travel website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html)** to fill out the necessary forms. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time as passport processing often takes several months and could take longer during peak travel periods. Processing is often 10 weeks for routine requests and 6 weeks for expedited service.

In addition to needing a passport for international travel, some countries have also imposed temporary health-related entry requirements. To find out more about your destination's health requirements, please use our **[interactive map.](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/travel-planning-center/find-your-destination/explore-top-destinations)**

**Why is Delta making adjustments to my  flight schedule?**

Travel itineraries are adjusted based on a range of factors, such as needing to better accommodate flight routes and demand, arrival and departure times and changes to aircraft types. These normal adjustments are referred to as schedule changes and allow us to better operate to meet customer needs.

**How do I know if there are travel requirements for my trip?**

We want you to arrive prepared, so please visit the **[Delta Discover Map](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/travel-planning-center/find-your-destination/explore-top-destinations?prices=false)** to learn about potential travel requirements for a trip you are planning or have booked. The information is up-to-date and personalized based on your specific circumstances.  Entry and exit requirements are imposed by governments and may change before departure, so please be sure to check back close to your intended travel dates for the latest requirements.

Also, if you book an international flight, your trip may be eligible for **[Delta FlyReady<sup>SM</sup>](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/flyready/overview)** which makes managing travel requirements faster and easier by guiding you through the process.

**Can minors and unaccompanied minors (UMNRs) travel internationally at this time?**

Yes.  International UMNR travel has resumed. However, there are some restrictions on travel based on individual country requirements or travel on other airlines.  Contact Reservations at 800-325-8847 for more detail related to international travel for UMNRs.

**Can minors and UMNRs travel domestically at this time?**

Yes, minors are free to travel on all domestic flights.

**What are the travel requirements for entry into the United States from a foreign destination?**

All travelers must provide a valid passport, proper visa documentation (if required) and contact tracing information when entering or connecting through the U.S**.**

**[Review full requirements and exceptions](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/travel-planning-center/know-before-you-go/travel-to-the-us)**.

**When should I call for assistance?**

In general, you can use [**My Trips**](https://www.delta.com/mytrips/index.action) as the quickest way to resolve most ticket changes and issues. However, the following scenarios cannot currently be changed via My Trips and you will have to call for assistance:

- A form of payment used includes a combination of cash and miles or an upgrade using miles or certificates
- An adult traveling with an infant in arms
- Tickets that are sold or ticketed by another airline – generally, this means your flight number will start with something other than "DL", except for SkyMiles Award Travel operated by a Delta airline partner

If you are ready to book your new trip now, it’s easy to locate and redeem your **[eCredit online.](https://www.delta.com/edocs/redeem-documents)** If you don’t see your eCredit or have an issue booking on delta.com, please have your old ticket number ready when you call our **[Reservations team](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/need-help/overview?src=needhelp1)**. Your ticket number is a 13-digit number beginning with 006. You can locate the ticket number on your emailed flight purchase receipt.

**What if I am having trouble changing travel using My Trips?**

Most travel changes can be easily completed through My Trips, but if you are experiencing difficulties, our [**How To Change or Cancel Your Flight**](https://www.delta.com/eu/en/travel-planning-center/change-or-cancel-your-trip/how-to-cancel-or-change-your-flight) page will help guide you.
